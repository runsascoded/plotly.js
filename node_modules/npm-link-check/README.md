CLI utility that checks whether a project's current node modules tree contains npm-link'ed packages.

So that you don't build a distributed bundle containing linked packages ever again!

`npm-link-check` even works with npm [scoped](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scope) packages. Big ups [@Istenes](https://github.com/Istenes) for that PR :beers:


## Install

```bash
# for CLI use:
npm install -g npm-link-check

# for npm-script use:
npm install npm-link-check
```

## Usage

#### CLI

```bash
# to check current working directory
npm-link-check

# to check arbitrary project
npm-link-check path/to/project/root
```

`npm-link-check` will log something like:

```
Some npm-link\'ed packaged were found:
    - package dummy (at node_modules/dummy) is linked
```

and exit with code `1` if one or many packages npm-link'ed are found. Big ups to [@c-eliasson](https://github.com/c-eliasson) for cleaning that up!

#### As a pre-version check

In this era of bundled and transpiled javascript, it is common for projects to
build a distributed version when running the [`npm
version`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version) task. Using `npm-link-check`, the
often neglected check for npm-link'ed packages can automated as follow:

In your project's `package.json`, add:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "preversion": "npm-link-check"
  }
}
```

making `npm-link-check` run on `npm version` before your package's version is
bumped. If an npm-link'ed package if found, the `npm version` task will be
aborted.
